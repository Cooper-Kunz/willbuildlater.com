Me and some friends started building this at Hack Arizona 2017, but never got around to working on it after the event.

Inspired by Disney's Baymax, we thought there should be a way to get simple instructions on how to solve basic healthcare issues from a voice activated device (Alexa), like having a bloody nose.
