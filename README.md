# Willbuildlater.com
A website dedicated to things I keep telling myself that I'll build (or finish) later

Eventually, I'd like to turn it into an example of how you can build full featured applications using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), and allow others to post their ideas that they haven't gotten around to building either

## Technologies used
- [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) - A blazingly fast, static website generator
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - Continuous integration / deployment

## Requirements
`gatsby cli`

## Installation
`npm install`

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`

## Running in production
`gatsby build`

## Acnkowledgments
